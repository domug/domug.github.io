I"–<p><strong>Regular Expression</strong> is a bunch of patterns that can be used to extract specific combinations of strings in a text. It is widely used in domains like NLP (Natural Language Processing) to handle text data and has lots of usages especially in the data preprocessing steps.</p>

<p>So in the following posts, we will talk about how to utilize some of the most important regular expressions in python with simple examples.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="re-package-in-python">â€œreâ€ package in python</h1>

<p>In python, we can use regular expressions by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">re</code> package. It is a bulit-in package in python, so we just need to import it to use it right away.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import re</code></p>

<p>Thereâ€™s not much of a theoretical background to be explained here, but keep in mind that almost every methods in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">re</code> package work in the following syntax:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">re.method_name(pattern, string)</code></p>

<p>With this being said, letâ€™s dig into each methods!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-rematch">1. re.match()</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">match()</code> method searches if the provided pattern exists at the <strong>beginning</strong> of a string. This method cannot consider multiple lines.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s an example.</p>

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/re/match.png" />
</p>

<p>The printed result of the first line of code indicates that the pattern we are looking for is at the 0th index of the string that we provided. Since indices in python starts with 0, it is equivalent to saying that the pattern is at the very beginning of the string.</p>

<p>Note that the prefix â€œrâ€ in front of each patterns simply indicates that it is a regular expression. It doesnâ€™t have any functionality, so itâ€™s up to you whether to include it for explicitation or not. The following code works exactly the same as above.</p>

</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-research">2. re.search()</h2>

<p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">match()</code> method only considered a single sentence, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search()</code> method is an extension of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">match()</code> and can work with multiple lines, but it only <strong>returns the first match</strong>. So basically, it searches everywhere in the provided string and returns the first element that matches your pattern. Itâ€™s commonly used for checking if a specific element is included in a sentence.</p>

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/re/search.png" />
</p>

<p>We can see that all of our examples returned â€œaâ€ and its index as it is included in all of the strings that we provided.</p>

<p>Now that we have the matched result, how can we actually extract the â€œactualâ€ element? Like in above examples we want to get exact â€œaâ€ instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">re</code> object.</p>

<p>Regarding this, there are 3 methods such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">group()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">end()</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">group()</code>: <strong>returns the matched element</strong></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start()</code>: <strong>returns the start index</strong> of matched element</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">end()</code>: <strong>returns the end index</strong> of matched element</li>
</ul>

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/re/group.png" />
</p>

<p>The results are presented accordingly.</p>

<p>On top of this, we can also include logical expressions in patterns. For example, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code> to indicate <strong>OR</strong> expression like the following examples.</p>

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/re/or.png" />
</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-refindall">3. re.findall()</h2>

<p>As its name explictly suggests, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findall()</code> method finds and pulls out <strong>all the matched instances as a list</strong>. Since there can be multiple return values, information about index is excluded.</p>

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/re/findall.png" />
</p>

<p>As the returned value is in a list form, we can apply all of the properties of list datatype in python like list indexing and slicing.</p>

<hr />

<p>The way how we found matching elements so far is called as <strong>Literal Matching</strong>. What it means is that we designate specific values inside the patterns like â€œaâ€, or â€œloveâ€ etc. This method can be inefficient if the pattern we are trying to search gets very complicated.</p>

<p>Therefore, in more complex situations we often define regular expression patterns by <strong>Character Sets</strong> with <strong>Quantifiers</strong>. Letâ€™s take a look at each!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="4-character-sets">4. Character Sets</h2>

<p><strong>Character Sets</strong>, or equivalently <strong>Character Classes</strong>, is providing some <strong>â€œsets of elementsâ€</strong> in the patterns. For instance, if we want to find â€œalphabetsâ€ in the string, we can use character set that represents alphabets instead of specifying all of the alphabets in the pattern. It might not make sense at the moment, but soon it will be clear after seeing examples.</p>

<p>We are going to take a look at the most frequently used 6 character sets - â€œ\wâ€, â€œ\Wâ€, â€œ\dâ€, â€œ\Dâ€, â€œ\sâ€, â€œ\Sâ€.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-1-w-lower-case-w">4-1. \w (lower case w)</h3>

<p>In regular expression, \w represents any character within the set [a-zA-Z0-9_]. In other words, it can be <strong>any alphabet (regardless of case), number and underbar</strong>.</p>

<p>Notice that it <strong>does not match any symbols except for the underbar ( _ )</strong>.</p>
