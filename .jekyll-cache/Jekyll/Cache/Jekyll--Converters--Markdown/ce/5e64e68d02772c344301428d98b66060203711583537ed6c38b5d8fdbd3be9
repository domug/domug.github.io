<h1 id="cluster-analysis-ca">Cluster Analysis (CA)</h1>

<p>In this post, we will be talking about <strong>Cluster Analysis</strong>. Until now we have seen PCA and FA which reduced dimensionality of the original data in terms of its ‚Äúvariables‚Äù. Both methods decomposed data matrix by its column vectors, so we were able to find a subset of variables that accounts for enough information of the original data. However, cluster analysis performs dimension reduction on <strong>observations</strong>, that is, by <strong>row vectors</strong>. This difference very important so always keep in mind!</p>

<p>The goal of cluster analysis is to find groups or clusters that can ‚Äúadequately‚Äù separate and group the observations. Since the word ‚Äúadequately‚Äù is a little vague in its meaning, we can define the adequacy as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>observations inside the same clusters are similar as possible</strong></li>
  <li><strong>observations within different clusters are different as possible</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>However, even in the above definition we have another ambiguousness. How are we going to measure the similarity and dissimilarity of each observations? Here‚Äôs where we need the concept of <strong>‚Äúmathematical distance‚Äù</strong>. To define distance, we foremost need a ‚Äúmeasure‚Äù and there are various definitions of different mathematical measures to define the distance between two objects.</p>

</p>

<p>Above is an example of lists of different distances, but all of them are defined to do one single thing - to measure the <strong>‚Äúcloseness‚Äù</strong> of objects. The ‚Äúcloser‚Äù the objects are, the more homogeneous or similar they are. Since going into the details of all of the distances above is tedious and time consuming, let‚Äôs focus on the fundamentals of the concept of distance.</p>

<p>Normally when we think in terms of distance between two things, we are mostly familiar</p>

<p>I will not go into details of each distance measurements, but important thing to remember about the concept of distance is that it does not</p>

<p>So in this post we will</p>
