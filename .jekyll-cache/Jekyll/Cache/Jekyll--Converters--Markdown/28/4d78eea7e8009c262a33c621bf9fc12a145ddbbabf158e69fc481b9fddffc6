I"Í<p>I first came across with the concept of entropy while reading a short fiction named â€œ<em>Entropy</em>â€ by <em>Thomas Pynchon</em>. As far as I remember, the main plot of the story was something to do with the current state of â€œdisorderâ€ slowly converging to â€œequilibriumâ€ and back then, I just thought entropy is some abstract concept related to the chaotic status quo (plus I really had a hard time writing report about it for my homework).</p>
