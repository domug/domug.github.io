<p>As a final topic of this series, we will talk about <strong>discriminant analysis</strong> and what it exactly does.</p>

<p>By now, you might be puzzled by different statistical dimension reduction methods which seem to be doing similar stuffs. When I first studied this topic, all these methods were tangled inside my head and I couldn’t figure out their differences. So before going into the details on the discriminant analysis, I want to spend some time to figure out the subtle differences in the methods we’ve studied so far.</p>

<p>So far we’ve looked at PCA, FA and CA. Let’s focus on the main goal of each. First of all, CA is evidently straightforward in that it tries to group the variables by making clusters based on the distances. On the other hand, PCA, FA and DA, which is today’s topic, aim to find a <strong>linear combination</strong> of the original variables for their distinctive purposes. So these three methods are very similar by their nature, though their main focus is different.</p>

<p>To illustrate the difference, let’s borrow some concepts from machine learning discipline. PCA and FA are <strong>“unsupervised models”</strong> while DA is a <strong>“supervised model”</strong>. That is, unlike PCA and FA where we don’t need any output variables, Discriminant Analysis requires output classes to be supplied. This is because DA focuses on <strong>maximizing the separability between each classes</strong>. On the other hand, PCA merely aims to re-express the data in terms of components which maximize the variance in the data, and FA tries to reveal the latent variables by focusing on the shared variance between the original variables.</p>

<p>To put it simply, we can summarize the differences as follows:</p>

<p>Hope this makes you a little less confused on the distinction between each methods.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it’s time to really talk about discriminant analysis. In fact, I’ve already demonstrated some of the details. The keyword of discriminant analysis is <strong>“separation”</strong>, so we want to find some decent rule that can separate and classify the observations according to their classes. In this post we will focus on <strong>“Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)”</strong> in which we use linear function to separate observations. However, keep in mind that as LDA tries to separate the observations with lines, if we have variables that are complicatedly intertwined, we have to search for alternative rule with is beyond simple lines and this is called “Quadratic Discriminant Analysis”.</p>
