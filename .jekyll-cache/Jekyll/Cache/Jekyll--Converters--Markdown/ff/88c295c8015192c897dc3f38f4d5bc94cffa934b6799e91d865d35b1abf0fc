<h1 id="factor-analysis">Factor Analysis</h1>

<p>In line with PCA, Factor Analysis (FA) is another famous dimension reduction method widely used for finding <strong>latent variables</strong>. Latant variable refers to variables that are hidden. Let’s go back the example about BTS Jin that I illustrated when talking about multicollinearity. I said when there are variables about Jin’s appearance like “width of eye”, “length of eye”, “color of eye”, these variables can be compressed into a single variable - “eye”, which is a latent variable hidden behind those three variables.</p>

<p>Often the goal of factor analysis is to summarize the original dataset which has a lot of varibles by extracting some hidden commonalities in the variables. These commonalities are called as <strong>“factors”</strong> and they are used throughout subsequent statiscal analysis. So it is easy to think the factors as some groups of original variables. In mathematical sense, it is to reduce a p-dimensional random vector X into a fewer “k” latent variables.</p>

<p>Usually it is most common to use continuous &amp; quantitative variables as our example will be so, but keep in mind that sometimes qualitative can also be used. For example, we might have nominal data such as [0, 1] where each number represents gender. In this case we can use factor analysis to find out gender characteristics or so.</p>

<p>Then let’s dig into the details of factor analysis. You might wonder, “then what is the difference between PCA and FA?”. This can formally be understood by looking at an equation of factor analysis.</p>
