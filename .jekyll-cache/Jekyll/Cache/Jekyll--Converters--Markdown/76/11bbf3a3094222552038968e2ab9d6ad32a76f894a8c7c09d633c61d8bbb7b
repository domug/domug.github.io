<h1 id="discriminant-analysis-da">Discriminant Analysis (DA)</h1>

<p>As a final topic of this series, we will talk about <strong>discriminant analysis</strong> and what it exactly does.</p>

<p>By now, you might be puzzled by different statistical dimension reduction methods which seem to be doing similar stuffs. When I first studied this topic, all these methods were tangled inside my head and I couldnâ€™t figure out their differences. So before going into the details on the discriminant analysis, I want to spend some time to figure out the subtle differences in the methods weâ€™ve studied so far.</p>

<p>So far weâ€™ve looked at PCA, FA and CA. Letâ€™s focus on the main goal of each. First of all, CA is evidently straightforward in that it tries to group the variables by making clusters based on the distances. On the other hand, PCA, FA and DA, which is todayâ€™s topic, aim to find a <strong>linear combination</strong> of the original variables for their distinctive purposes. So these three methods are very similar by their nature, though their main focus is different.</p>

<p>To illustrate the difference, letâ€™s borrow some concepts from machine learning discipline. PCA and FA are <strong>â€œunsupervised modelsâ€</strong> while DA is a <strong>â€œsupervised modelâ€</strong>. That is, unlike PCA and FA where we donâ€™t need any output variables, Discriminant Analysis requires output classes to be supplied. This is because DA focuses on <strong>maximizing the separability between each classes</strong>. On the other hand, PCA merely aims to re-express the data in terms of components that can maximize the variance in the data, and FA tries to reveal the latent variables by focusing on the shared variance between the original variables.</p>

<p>To put it simply, we can summarize the differences as follows:</p>

<p>Hope this makes you a little less confused on the distinction between each methods.</p>

<p>With this in mind, itâ€™s time to really talk about discriminant analysis. In fact, Iâ€™ve already demonstrated some of the details. The keyword of discriminant analysis is <strong>â€œseparationâ€</strong>, so we want to find some decent rule that can separate and classify the observations according to their classes. In this post we will focus on <strong>â€œLinear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)â€</strong>, which is a major branch of DA that tries to separate observations using linear functions. However, keep in mind that in situations where our observations are intertwined and cannot be separated by lines, we have to use more complicated separation rule beyond simple lines and this is called â€œQuadratic Discriminant Analysisâ€.</p>

<p>Anyways, an example of discriminant analysis is â€œcredit evaluation modelâ€. If we have data on a specific personâ€™s financial activities such as â€œnumber of loansâ€, â€œdelinquency rateâ€ et cetera, we want to classify that person into one of the classes from 1 ~ 10. So if a person has good traits, by LDA that person is likely to be classified into higher classes like 1 or 2.</p>

<p>Important point here is that LDA must have some amount of <strong>â€œtraining datasetâ€</strong> with output groups specified in order to find the separation rule. These rules are obtained by using <strong>â€œDiscriminant Functionâ€</strong> and LDA is all about how to define and find this function.</p>

<p>The most famous rules include â€œMaximum Likelihood Discriminant Ruleâ€, â€œBayes Discriminant Ruleâ€ and â€œFisherâ€™s Linear Discrimination Ruleâ€, and each methods uses different discrimination functions. However, their basic ideas are the same. That is, each rules aim to minimize the classification error.</p>

<p>Consider above figure. The dotted line represents a linear discriminant function which serves as a milestone to separate observations into groups A and B. In the distribution presented at the bottom, we see a <strong>grey zone</strong> in the middle where the two distributions gets overlapped. The area of this grey zone is</p>
