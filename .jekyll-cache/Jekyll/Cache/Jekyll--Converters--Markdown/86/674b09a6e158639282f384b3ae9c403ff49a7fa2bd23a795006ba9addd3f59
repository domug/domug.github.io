<p>As a final topic of this series, we will talk about <strong>discriminant analysis</strong> and what it exactly does.</p>

<p>By now, you would have probably felt that there are lots of different methods regarding statistical dimension reduction and they could be tangled up in your head because they all seem to be doing similar stuffs. To be honest, it‚Äôs the reason why I‚Äôve decided to write blog posts on these issues because I get confused as well. While studying on this topic, what I‚Äôve found out is that the main focus or goal of each method are slightly different.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, Discriminant Analysis and the two previous methods, PCA and FA, are very similar by their nature. All three methods try to find the <strong>linear combination</strong> of the original variables to re-express the data. Nevertheless even if they share the same concept, their main focus on the implementation are all different.</p>

<p>For instance, PCA does not take into account the classes (or labels) of each variables and aims to re-express</p>

<p>For instance, PCA does not take into account any possible existence of groups. PCA simply changes our viewpoint of looking at a data and that‚Äôs all. On the other hand, FA and DA tries to extract the commonalities in the original variables by focusing on the ‚Äúdissimilarity‚Äù between groups. In FA, these groups are called as ‚Äúfactors‚Äù and in DA they are <strong>‚Äúdiscriminant functions‚Äù</strong>, which will be discussed in a minute. But FA and DA also differs by the point that</p>
