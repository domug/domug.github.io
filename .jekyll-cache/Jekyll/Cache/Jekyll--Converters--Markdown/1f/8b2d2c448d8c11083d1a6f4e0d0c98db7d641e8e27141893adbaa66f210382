<p>In line with PCA, Factor Analysis (FA) is another famous dimension reduction method widely used for finding <strong>latent variables</strong>. Latant variable refers to variables that are hidden. Letâ€™s go back the example about BTS Jin that I illustrated when talking about multicollinearity. I said when there are variables about Jinâ€™s appearance like â€œwidth of eyeâ€, â€œlength of eyeâ€, â€œcolor of eyeâ€, these variables can be compressed into a single variable - â€œeyeâ€, which is a latent variable hidden behind those three variables.</p>

<p>Often the goal of factor analysis is to summarize the original dataset which has a lot of varibles by extracting some hidden commonalities in the variables. These commonalities are called as <strong>â€œfactorsâ€</strong> and they are used throughout subsequent statiscal analysis. So it is easy to think the factors as some groups of original variables. In mathematical sense, it is to reduce a p-dimensional random vector X into a fewer â€œkâ€ latent variables.</p>

<p>Usually it is most common to use continuous &amp; quantitative variables as our example will be so, but keep in mind that sometimes qualitative can also be used. For example, we might have nominal data such as [0, 1] where each number represents gender. In this case we can use factor analysis to find out gender characteristics or so.</p>

<p>Then letâ€™s dig into the details of factor analysis. You might wonder, â€œthen what is the difference between PCA and FA?â€. This can formally be understood by looking at an equation of factor analysis.</p>
